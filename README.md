# 🎓 Scholarship Predictor: Intelligent Scholarship Recommender using TensorFlow

An AI-powered web application that predicts a student's eligibility for scholarships based on academic, extracurricular, and financial data.  
Built using **Python (Flask)** and **TensorFlow**, the system automates scholarship selection with fairness, transparency, and accuracy.

---

## 📘 Overview
The **Scholarship Predictor** project aims to eliminate manual bias in scholarship selection by leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.  
Traditional evaluations often depend on subjective judgment — this system introduces a **data-driven**, **automated**, and **scalable** approach to decision-making.
